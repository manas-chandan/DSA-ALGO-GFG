# Digit count of an integer




## My Approach

Time complexity = O(n)

Space complexity = O(n)

Here I am trying solve the probelm by my own mathod and simple method
by remove one one element from right side and count by count variable.


## Best Approach
Time complexity = O(1)

Space complexity = O(1)

Here probelm sloved by assign the int to string and simply print the length.
## run

To run this project run

```bash
  javac ClassName.javac
  java ClassName
```
