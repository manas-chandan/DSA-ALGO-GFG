# Here we are sort the int array element #

# My Approach #
-----------------------------------
## Time complexity = O(nlogn) ##
## Space complexity = O(nlogn) ##
	Here I am trying solve the probelm by my own mathod and simple method

# Best Approach #
-----------------------------------
## Time complexity = O(nlogn) ##
## Space complexity = O(nlogn) ##

	Here we can use some pre made method called sort() available util package.
