# Sorting Of int[] array




## My Approach

Time complexity = O(nlogn)

Space complexity = O(nlogn)

Here I am trying solve the probelm by my own mathod and simple method


## Best Approach
Time complexity = O(nlogn)

Space complexity = O(nlogn)

Here probelm sloved by pre-made method of java called sort() present in java.util package.
## run

To run this project run

```bash
  javac Demo.javac
  java Demo
```
